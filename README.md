## How it Works
1. Select at least one object
2. Input the amount you wish to resize the object by
3. Click "Resize"

### Objects with Parents
If the object is inside another container it will resize **based on the parent dimensions** .

### Objects without Parents
The object will resize **based on its own dimensions**.

### 🔗Constrained Proportions
The plugin will preserve this if only one dimension is set.
